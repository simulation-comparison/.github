# Simulation comparison database (scdb)

## Repositories

- [scdb-ri](https://github.com/simulation-comparison/scdb-ri) Simulation comparison database for ionizing radiation.

## Overview

In computational modelling and simulation, establishing metrological traceability and rigorous benchmarking standards is essential for ensuring reliable and reproducible results. This GitHub organization hosts repositories dedicated to systematic comparisons of simulation software, with a focus on creating traceable reference data and standardized benchmarks analogous to those used in experimental metrology.

Just as experimental measurements require validation against standards and inter-laboratory comparisons, computational simulations need similar frameworks for establishing confidence and uncertainty quantification. By providing transparent, version-controlled comparison studies, these repositories aim to advance computational metrology and help researchers make informed decisions about simulation tools and methods.

## Purpose

Repositories under this organization may provide:

- **Metrological benchmarks:** Standardized test cases with reference solutions for validating simulation software

- **Traceable comparisons:** Version-controlled, reproducible studies documenting differences between simulation tools and methods

- **Validation against experiment:** Where available, comparison with experimental data or analytical solutions

- **Uncertainty documentation:** Systematic evaluation of discrepancies and their sources

## History

The idea that motivated this `simulation-comparison` GitHub organization is the `scdb-ri` repository, devoted to comparing various Monte Carlo software toolkits for modelling ionizing radiation transport. It is modelled after the BIPM KCDB (Key Comparison Database), the international reference for experimental metrological comparisons, adapting these principles to the computational domain.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from researchers and practitioners interested in advancing computational metrology and simulation validation. Each repository contains specific guidelines for contributing to that particular area.
